# Game Project Scope Study

## Required Readings

-   [Game Project](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/game-project)
-   [Game API](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/game-project-api)

## Deliverables

After reading the `game-project` prompt and the `game-project-api` documentation
please do the following and be prepared to share and discuss during our next
class.

Submit detailed answers to these in this file via a pull request.

-   A wireframe of what your game project will look like.
 See additional file?

-   The data structure you plan to use.

I'm not sure if this answers the question properly but the data structure would rely on central logic and little options- if one option is fulfilled, then something will happen as opposed to if another action is selected, a different option will be executed. It won't be entirely linear.

-   How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS

I plan to take the markup of the gameboard as an array and represent it as an empty array in JS that can be changed and saved depending on the user input.


-   How you plan to approach this project.

I plan to approach this project by first having my wireframe, building the JS game logic and making sure that it actually works just in the console, the  building the HTML and typing the two together. The final step will involve formatting it with CSS and adding more featurs.

-   4-8 user stories for your game project.


 a. As a user, I want to be able to make a move limited to free spaces so that the game continues as planned.
 b. As a user, I want the game to be able to keep track of the score so that I don't have to manually.
 c. As a user, I want to be able to select which character I am instead of having some sort of first-player advantage default.
 d. As a user I want to be able to log in and sign up to keep track of my score.


-   How you plan to keep your code modular.

When writing my code, I'll keep going back through and seeing if I can combine multiple functions to make the code more simple and concise. I'll also trim a lot of fat to ensure that after my code works, it can be made more simple.

-   What creative spin will you add to your project.

The creative spin I want to put on it is, right now, playing as a different house from Game of Thrones {so long as it isn't blatant copyright infringement}. Ideally, whichever house the first plaer selects can be applied as "player x" and the second can be "player y" rather than having separate code for each house.

-   How you will use version control to backup / track your project.

For every major addition {and even minor}, I'll save to git so I have a clear record of my process. If I need to experiment, I'll checkout to a new branch.


-   Do you plan to attempt any of the bonuses.

If I have time, I want some degreeof token customization, some animation, and a tracker for multiple rounds.
